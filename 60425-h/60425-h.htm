  <h2 class='c007'>ACT I.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Scene 1.</span>—<i>Streets of Mobile.</i> <span class='sc'>D’Arneaux</span> <i>discovered looking over some papers R. Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Zina</span> <i>L, carrying a heavy carpet-bag</i>. D’A. <i>recognizes her</i>.</h3>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>D’Arneaux.</span> Ah! your master and myself seem to be of
one mind today. I did not see you on the train. When do
you return?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> When master has drank enough and played his money
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Zina, you have been weeping. Some more abuse?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, please don’t ask me anything, master.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Zina, do you like your master?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Please don’t ask me to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Now, my little one, do you think you would be happier
if you should come to live at our cottage?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, I should be so glad, Master D’Arneaux; but I
can not think of that, it is so impossible!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. My mother seems so happy when you come over to
sing to her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I pity her so much; she is so helpless and lonely since
Nelly died.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Zina, you could be a daughter to my mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> She seems to stop mourning for Nelly when I sing to
her, and her face lights up with the old smile as it used to do,
when I used to come over to learn to read and sing.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. If I should buy you off your master, how would you
like it?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, please, Master D’Arneaux, don’t give me a hope
like that! When disappointment comes it makes me feel so bad.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Now, why would you be glad to come with us?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> You have been so kind to me. Oh, if you will buy
me, I will work so hard for you!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Are you not happy in your old home?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina</span> (<i>looking about</i>). Please don’t tell master! but I get
so tired—My life is so hopeless, and the driver beats me so
hard—</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Why do they do that? I always see you at work.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Because I hid in the swamp when he was trying to sell
me to some brutal traders from the coast. Oh, please buy me,
Master D’Arneaux! I will work for you day and night and eat
the poor food after the other hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. But you have seemed to be so much attached to your
master, I had hardly dared to broach the matter of adding your
pretty face and good heart to the family of my mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, please do not say what I tell you! they would
whip me so. I force myself to appear happy and contented, to
please master. He is so cross when he finds me crying. Oh,
he drinks so much! You will not tell him what I have said?
(<i>Falls on her knees, sobbing.</i>) I am so fearful of a worse fate
than that.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Have they dared to insult you while you are but a
child?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, please buy me, Master D’Arneaux, I am so <i>miserable</i>
now.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Zina, your honor is more sacred than your life, and you
have the right to defend it to the death, even against your master
(<i>handing stiletto</i>). Take this knife and kill the miscreant
who would insult you.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina</span> (<i>kissing and hugging it to her bosom</i>). Oh, I am so
helpless alone with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Zina, you were not born to be a slave. God has not
put the stamp of that race in your angel face. Your brain is
sharper than your master’s. Think! at fourteen you read as
well as the best at the plantation. In music you are a prodigy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, Master D’Arneaux, you are always so kind to me.
Heaven is good to your help when it gives so good a master.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. It is Heaven, too, that gives <i>you</i> so much of sympathy
and goddness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I have thought I was so bad, Master D’Arneaux.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>D’A. Why did you think that, my little one?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> The driver says, only the wicked are unhappy. Oh,
it is so hard for me to be good.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. You make a very grave mistake, Zina. The best people
that have lived have been full of tears.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I feel so much better when I can cry.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. So did you cry when our Nelly died, yet you had done
no wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). She was such a sister to me, when I was
only a miserable slave. She learned me to sing and your mother
learned me to read—</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. And you have repaid my poor, helpless old mother
with so many beautiful songs—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> How else can I pay her for all that makes sunshine
for my miserable life?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Zina, you are a noble girl. Too good and pure for
labor among the coarse field hands. Heaven never made you
for this. Your brain and voice came from Him who gives such
gifts for a nobler purpose. To scatter happiness as He scatters
beautiful wild flowers in the uninviting nooks of the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, I do not know what to say, Master D’Arneaux,
you are so good to me. (<i>Zina rises.</i>) If you buy me, may I
have a little bed of flowers? I will take care of them when
there is no work to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. All the flowers you please, little one, where you like,
and your own time to work in them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, I am so glad! I forget all my misery and unhappiness
when I am doing that.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. It is an evidence of a pure and noble heart to love
the beautiful.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Please don’t tell master, but he stamps on my flowers
and tells me to waste my time in the cotton field. Oh! I try so
hard to please him, that he won’t order the driver to beat me!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. He is a brutal dog!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Please don’t say so to him. He will know I have
been saying something to you (<i>taking bag and goes to R</i>). Oh,
I must go now! He is so angry when I am gone too long.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. But he knows you are after the baggage?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> And he knows I have had time to go and get back
(<i>dropping on knees</i>). Oh, please buy me, Master D’Arneaux,
I am so unhappy now! I will work so hard to get your money
back.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>D’A. (<i>Brushing hair from forehead.</i>) Dry the tears, little
one, I will see what I can do for you.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, you will try, won’t you, Master D’Arneaux? I
am so fearful that I shall be sold to some traders tomorrow.
(<i>Seizes and passionately kisses D’A.’s hand, Zina rises slowly,
covering face, then hurries out R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. I <i>will</i> try (<i>looking after her</i>)! That was a rash
promise. What if he shall demand more than I have? That
would sweep my mother’s comforts away (<i>overcome</i>). My God!
Can it be right that such innocence should be given to the mercy
of such brutes? If this system is divine, it is <i>not</i> divine that
devils should own or handle it. If in the coming conflict I shall
fall, what next? Poor Cora, when I told her my duty was at the
front, and I trusted my mother to her care, that look of agony
I shall never forget, as she gathered her babies to her heart and
said: “Master, I could always be a slave for you, but if you
are killed, what will become of my baby boys?” It has rung in
my ears like the knell of hope, <i>forever</i> since. Poor woman!
They shall never send your children to the auction block to pay
a debt for me. If from shame I left her then without an answer,
she shall have it today from the best of my manhood. I will
free my people before I go. The land and cottage will keep my
mother—Ah, I had forgotten Brightly’s mortgage! My
death may send my mother to the poor-house (<i>thinking</i>). The
proceeds of my last crop will clear this, or buy the girl. Heaven
help me to do right! (<i>Exit R.</i>)</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scene 2.</span> <i>Cafe in Hotel Leon, Mobile.</i> <span class='sc'>Myers</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Brightly</span> <i>are discovered seated at a card table L. Bar rear centre.</i></h3>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> A fact, as said old Bob, “Cotton is king,” and
a truer boast never was made.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Some idle slush that happens to suit the vanity of
the cotton growers. Our roosters always strut the loudest.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Why not? If two hundred millions’ worth of
cotton never crossed the sea, how long would you have to hunt
for a gold coin on the Atlantic seaboard?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> What of your gold mines?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> A drop, only. Shut off the cotton production
and how would we carry on a foreign trade?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Exchange your cereals. Again,—if you had nothing
to buy with, you wouldn’t buy. No matter how much you
produce here, you are forced to part with it to feed your always
famished vanity. Before California, your cotton, cereals
and meat went. Now it is California as well! Mark this: If
thrown on your own resources, without a particle of foreign importation,
you would be infinitely better off, because it would
give an impetus to the development of your natural resources,
so unparalleled.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Come to natural resources, how came New
York and New England with their wealth, and how would your
pauper labor obtain their cheap clothing?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Egypt can raise cotton enough for the world. Thrift,
hard labor and plenty of brains will make anybody what he
needs.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Of course, even if the business was basswood,
hams and Peter Funk jewelry.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> It is not to your credit that they find a susceptible
market here.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Why, Myers, we run the rest of this country
as middlemen. We have tolerated the leeches a hundred years.
Now we propose to shut down.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> When you will spoil the whole. (<i>Enter Hood R.</i>)
It takes brains to run a country like this, and the south haven’t
got the material.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Indeed!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Yes, sir; indeed. It is one thing to raise cotton
and another thing to make it valuable. You never had sense
enough in the south to utilize it. If you have, where are
your mills? The south is loaded with water-power. The
brains of the country are in New England and the middle states.
Kick those friends in the face and where are you? England,
you say? They would hold the same relation to you at once.
What do you gain? An enemy on the border. I owe allegiance
to the British crown, but I like your country. It will be
my future home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I was going to say—that I was afraid this country
couldn’t do without ye.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Sum the south and its institutions, and what is it?
Planters who know nothing but to buy and work a nigger. A
large element whose highest ambition is hog, hominy, a horse
race and whiskey enough for the present. Politicians, who discover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>nothing but that the north is leeching its living from the
south and stealing its niggers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> How much would it cost to get two or three
Johnny Bulls like you to come over and run this machine?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Sarcasm don’t answer argument. It takes a variety
of people and interests to make a country like this. I have
travelled it all over. It’s a big thing. Believe me, gentlemen,
when I say that you require New England for its manufacturing
push, the west for its bread and meat, the south for its cotton
and sugar. Kick out one and you spoil the whole.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Myers, you should have chosen the law instead
of Faro and speckelatin in niggers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Why?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> You got so much cheek, and you can twist a lie
so it will look like a fact.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Now don’t insult me!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Oh, get out! You are as sensitive as a Yankee
nigger stealer. (<i>Enter D’Arneaux R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Good morning, gentlemen. Brightly, please say to
my mother, pressing business calls me to Charleston, at once.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> The devil! What is up now?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. The last dispatches announce that the bombardment
of Sumter has commenced.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Jest as I expected.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. I enter the army tonight, Capt. Hood, may I expect
to enter under your command?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Sorry, but my company is full. Everything is full.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Why not stick to the Regulators? You got a
commission there?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Then I will return to Creelsboro tonight, take leave
of my mother in the morning, then hie for the frontier.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> What’s your rush? I can’t get ready as soon as
that!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. The state owns the right to my head and arm now.
A quick blow, and an honorable, bloodless peace.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Well said, my boy. We fight our own countrymen,
whose ancestors stood shoulder to shoulder with ours for the
first independence. The first shot makes me shudder, for I
cannot see the end.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. War is cruel, and I have hoped against hope that
it would not come.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> I like your sentiments, my boy. May I hope a bullet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>may never find you. But the north will fight. It is the exasperation
wrought by cruel pictures of the wrong we have
carried as best we could, through the first century of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Now, gentlemen, don’t get melancholy. Yankees
won’t fight. They are by instinct thieves and shopkeepers. I
will bet you my best nigger you can’t hire one to cross the line.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> I have travelled in that country some, and I will
meet your wager and go you one better, that you smell as much
Yankee gunpowder the next year as you can take care of.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Pointing to Myers, laughing.</i>) It’s chronic,
Johnny Bull!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Did I understand you that you are an Englishman?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> An Australian, sir, on a spec, plying between Mobile
and Havana. Got anything to sell?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Your line of trade?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> I prefer handsome women.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. And when he is tired of them, they are turned over to
another master in the auction yards of Havana.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Exactly. I made $700 on the last one.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> It remains for Old and New England to furnish the
men, that have loaded the south with its most ignominious
reputation. (<i>Myers springs to his feet.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Do you insult the legitimate business of your country?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> The absolute freedom the Republic confers upon
you has never legalized a crime against humanity.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> What say you, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> When this country opens its doors to the citizens of
another state, it expects no insults to its hospitality!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Do you fight, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> I do, sir, most assuredly.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. You can take your choice, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers</span> (<i>to D’Arneaux</i>). I have no quarrel with you, sir.
(<i>To Hood.</i>) You will hear from me in the morning. Your
profession, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> It is honorable, sir. Be assured that I feel the
degradation of the match as much as yourself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> This squabble with the free states has seemed to
convey the idea to every scrub in the south that he must carry
the honor of his own section on his own little back.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Squabble?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Well, what else? Neither section has an army, or
a respectable ship of war. There are not ten thousand men in
the country that know a right-shoulder shift from a present.
This is a fanatical mob broke loose.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Myers, it is cruelty to a lunatic to fight you.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Nothing collapses the vanity of a ponderous presumption
so quick as a ridiculous fact.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly</span> (<i>to Hood and D’Arneaux</i>). Oh, he knows it all.
(<i>To Myers.</i>) Look here. I knew of a Johnny Bull once that
had the conceit taken out of him by a little nation that made a
navy out of its little coasting schooners. It lays hard on Johnny’s
stomach to this day.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Whatever the merits of this quarrel may be, John
Bull will soon observe that it don’t take three years to make a
soldier on this side of the water.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Come, Brightly, as you and I have not quarrelled, let
us have a whack at the national game. (<i>Deals cards—they play.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Myers, you are the sauciest devil in Mobile.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Why?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Because you are the best shot, I suppose.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Then Mobile tolerates me, does it?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> It does.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Then suppose it should choose to do otherwise?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Some citizen would wring your nose and kick you out.
(<i>Myers springs to his feet, Brightly between.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Hold on, gentlemen. There’s time enough to
settle this hash in the morning. (<i>Pushes Myers to his chair.</i>)
Deal the cards.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> These gentlemen insist on being insultingly snappish.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> This is a slave state, sir, but not an auction room.
I desire you to understand the strength of my contempt for yourself
and the business that gives you a dishonorable living.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> If you should ever cross the water, do you think
anything in the line of Royalty would be able to obtain any condescension
from you?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> I associate with nothing but gentlemen, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> And I suppose you fight nothing but gentlemen, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> I sometimes kick a ruffian!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers</span> (<i>suppressed rage</i>). Indeed! We will see how hard
you kick, in the morning. Say, Brightly. Now you are off for
the army, sell me that little red-cheeked jade I saw carrying
your baggage to the depot.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><span class='sc'>Brightly</span> (<i>catching a look from D’A.</i>). No siree! That girl
is the smartest piece of meat in the whole of Tennessee! I
brought her up from a baby. Why, she can sing like an Opera,
and read—wal, she does all the readin’ and letter writin’ on the
plantation. (<i>Hood and D’A. converse—R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> I s’pose that all goes for talk!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Why, bless your heart, there ain’t a nigger or
white woman in Creelsboro’ that wouldn’t die for her! She’s
one er the institutions of that place.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Worth about a thousand more, I suppose, on account
of that! Never saw a Tennessee trader that didn’t have sixteen
or seventeen hundred dollars’ worth of extra virtues in his
particular nigger!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> On er bright, and no blowin’!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Oh the south is full of them!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Then go and buy ’em.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Brightly, I don’t know why, but I have just taken a
liking to that little romp. She is pretty and fresh as a new picture.
Say, she hasn’t been married?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Not a bit of it. She’s only jest sixteen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Say, I will give twelve hundred for her, because you
and I are old friends.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> No, yer don’t!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Fifteen?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> It’s no use talkin’! If I should sell that little
brat, there would be hell to pay in Creelsboro’ for two years.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Now look here, Brightly; when I take a liking I am
willing to pay for it. I am going to make you an offer you won’t
refuse—twenty-five hundred!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> You had better wait and see if you get by Hood
in the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> I shall kill him at the first shot.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> But he fires once, himself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> He will die too soon for that. I have never found
it necessary to fire twice. The other man always forgets to finish
his business.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Why, Myers, you hain’t no more idea of what
there is in that gal, than you have of kingdom come. (<i>Blows a
whistle, and Zina dashes in R, looking inquiringly.</i>) Ain’t that
jest the handsomest piece of furnicher ye ever looked at?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Beautiful!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Now I jest want you to hear her sing. Now, little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>one, hoe in. Do yer handsomest, and I’ll give yer four days
off.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh please, master, I feel so bad today. (<i>Falling on
her knees and covering her face.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly</span> (<i>Rising and drawing a whip from under his coat.</i>)
Ah ha! Sulks again? Niggers don’t say won’t to me.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Please don’t make me sing, master, today. (<i>Falls on
face sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). Ah, you won’t, hey? Then I will
give you something to sulk for. (<i>Advances towards her, and
D’Arneaux steps between. They look each other in the face a
moment. Brightly goes to seat again.</i>) The young one ain’t
well today.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Well, three thousand.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Catching a look from D’Arneaux.</i>) I’ll tell ye
tomorrow.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> I’ll bet ye five hundred on this hand without lookin’.
(<i>D’A. raises Zina up to knees. She clings to D’A.’s hands—face
hid.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> All right. My chance is as good as your’n, then.
Show!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers</span> (<i>as both show</i>). Got ye! This is a matter of pure
luck, and may as well be done blindfolded. Do you know I lost
fifteen thousand dollars once in Havana at one sitting?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Enough to make me rich! (<i>Rests face on hands.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> I was teetotally cleaned out. I put up my breastpin
and won. When I got up, I was five thousand dollars better
off than I was when I commenced. Try it again?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I have just about enough left to get me home
again. (<i>Turns away.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Borrow?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>To D’A.</i>) D’Arneaux, lend me a thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. I shall be obliged to use all I have tomorrow. I would
play no more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> I want him to win back part of this, so we can part
with good feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Then give it to him, and have done with it!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I refuse a gift from any one!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Any gentleman would say that.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Then return what you have won dishonestly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers</span> (<i>springing to his feet</i>). This is the second time you
have insulted me tonight, without provocation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>D’A. <i>Gentlemen</i> resent the first insult!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Can I expect to see you at “Bayou Sara” with your
friend in the morning?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. You can, sir! I prefer to meet you first myself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> It is immaterial to me.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Now, gentlemen, this quarrel is for nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. He has insulted the hospitality of my country. He
must carry his life in his hands for that!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Do your boasting after the fight. Brightly, I lend
you five hundred to continue the game. I want to go out from
here with one friend.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Jest as you say (<i>they seat at table</i>). I am going
to get ye this time. You dealt last (<i>deals cards</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Will bet you the even $500, and show as before.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Playin’ is all luck, anyway.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Do you go it?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Yes. What have ye got (<i>both show</i>)?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Sorry, Brightly. I was hoping you would win this.
Nevertheless, luck will come somewhere. Say, I will bet you
thirty-five hundred against the girl?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> No, I won’t! (<i>D’A. and Zina, excited, gather
nearer.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> That would give you a chance to win 2000 more
than you had when you commenced. Try it again.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Hesitating, finally brings his fist down on the
table.</i>) Done!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, master. (<i>Zina drops on her knees and bows her
head on Brightly, sobbing. Brightly throws her off.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. (<i>Dashing forward and flinging his pocket-book on the
table.</i>) No, by heaven, you shall not! There are eighteen
hundred dollars. It is all I have. Take it and say the girl is
free. Then <i>waste</i> the money if you like.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> (<i>To Brightly.</i>) Do you take this scoundrel through
the country as guardian for your property, because you are unfit
to handle it yourself?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> What I own I control. Deal the cards! It is
$3500 or the girl!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Thirty-five hundred dollars or the girl. Show (<i>both
show</i>.) You have lost again!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. And you have won dishonestly!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> You lie! (<i>Zina half rises in terror.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Take that money and let the girl go free.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Who are you (<i>rises and confronts</i>)?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. What are you?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Well, say it.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. A gambler with the honor of a thief.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> In the morning you shall swallow that.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. A libertine without an honorable thought!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> This shall be your last croak!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. A ruffian, whose business it is to send—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> Have done—</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Beauty and virtue to the auction block for prostitution!
(<i>Myers strikes D’Arneaux and is struck in return.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Myers.</span> I will not wait for morning to settle this. (<i>Flings
off hat, draws knife. Zina rises in terror.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. It shall be as you choose (<i>dashing to bar and seizing a
knife</i>). And the freedom of this helpless girl shall be the issue!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Dashing between.</i>) Hold on, gentlemen!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Stand aside, sir! This is a question of manhood you
are unfit to decide. (<i>Myers dashes by Brightly and attacks D’A.
They fight. Myers is killed L.  at once. D’A. drops his
knife and stands aghast at his work. Turning suddenly to R.</i>)
It is a poltroon who would not fight from such a provocation.
(<i>Zina drops on her knees sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. (<i>To Brightly.</i>) The result of this duel ends your
control as master here. (<i>Zina falls on face sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> When did I give papers to convey her?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. I sought the quarrel that has ended that miscreant’s
life, because he has lived in vandalism on the ruins of helpless
innocence!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> What is that to me?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. By every sense of even a gambler’s honor, this child is
free. If you deny that, it shall be the last time the law shall
protect your infamy. Peril her liberty and honor again if you
dare, and you shall answer to me. (<i>Curtain.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Either you please.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. The laws of every nation compel allegiance to the
country that gives its protection.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Protection, did you say?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Aye, protection!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> When this confederacy finds itself able to stand
alone, it may assume impudence enough to ask my allegiance
on account of the protection it can give.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. As did the colonies in the first insurrection, this government

enough to use such talk with a man. I fight to repel Yankee

<p class='c011'>D’A. A patriotism that simply asks protection for your
pocket.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Whose reaches farther?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Who has no pride in a magnificent nationality, would

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Well, who gets, or cares for more?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. He whose ambition leaps the instinct of the animal, to

This is simply a domestic fight.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Liberty and honor? The world very properly
forgot both when the crusade ended. A country hampered with
slavery and the arrogance of wealth, prating of liberty and
honor!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Well, you have graduated at a school that can say even
more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Honor is a bag of gas for the mouth. A presumptuous
idea manufactured for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Well?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> While driving a sharp bargain for a soul and body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>in a black hide, or speculating on deceptive conclusions, did
you ever feel it?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. I have done neither.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I spoke of the custom of the country you defend.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Well?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> What is liberty? An unwanted, useless thing,
stamped upon in every prosperous part of the country. Even
the old cradle of our fabled liberty rocks for the benefit of the
capitalist, who starves his brainless neighbor for the benefit of
his vanity. I do not disagree with him. From the beginning,
custom, law and tradition have said, it is to him that can. In
nature, the large fish eat the smaller. The same of the birds
and beasts. The <i>world</i> is a slave pen. Statutes never made a
man free. Take in the boasted freedom and civilization of New
England, are her working people more free than ours? Does
the working man dare assert the rights of a freeman there?
The hypocrisy of this presumption is manifest everywhere. The
rich demand the servile submission of the poor, and they give it
or starve! Be frank. Say that you fight to control for your
pocket and stomach. Unite with the slaveholders of the north
and shed no more aristocratic blood. Say he that works for
another is a slave, and I am with you.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Are you done?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> For the present.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. For the last three years the regulators have lived a life
of brigandage for your benefit. They now demand that you
shall receive your orders from the department commander.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Ah, indeed! Then they propose that the tail
shall wag the dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. The last trap to which you led cost half the command.
Take your orders from the proper source, or they refuse to follow
you farther.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> This is treason!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. In this instance, it is to him that can.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Then they would command?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Or be commanded for a less purposeless object.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> How long since these brainless brutes set themselves
up to direct the intellectual part of this campaign?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Since they have learned that they are without a competent
leader.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Are they not thieves and drunkards by instinct?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. I will convey the insult to the troops.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> And as much to yourself!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. When the country has used my life to its satisfaction,
I will resent that in a proper manner. For the present it shall
help to make the nation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> A nation? What are nations? The synonym of
two neighbors who fight across a fence over the scratch of a hen.
Their dogs assume the dangerous roles. If the leaders of this
breakup were compelled to shoulder a rifle and take themselves
to the front, there would be no war. Instead, that Christian
concession they call the “Peace Congress,” would come to the
front so quick, it would excite your admiration, and its present
auxiliaries would still live to swallow insults, instead of sneaking
behind the servile hounds they push to the front.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. And the brave and honorable Brigand Chief, whose
chivalrous ilk forbids such dishonor, would still steal on his
helpless enemy at night, though it wore a petticoat, in sightless
slumber, and compel the knife and torch to hide his cowardice!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Drawing knife.</i>) I will not wait for the birth of
a nation to settle that insult!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. (<i>Drawing.</i>) This result is your own seeking! (<i>As
they attempt to fight, Hood dashes in L. U. E. and intercepts.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Hold! Is there not blood enough wasted already?
(<i>Both attempt to speak.</i>) Not a word, gentlemen! There is a
chance for your sanguinary extravagance at the front. D’Arneaux,
an hour since you volunteered for the enemy’s lines. Do
you serve the army by quarrels with ruffians? Attend to your
business, or leave it with better hands. Now, too! (<i>Neither
move.</i>) I command here! (<i>Both leave slowly. Brightly L.,
D’A. R.</i>) So do the ruffianly elements divide my strength, and
ruin the efficiency of the army. Half the pickets are drunk or
asleep. I am not surprised that the federals push their advance
to our very camp fires. (<i>Hez. creeps on very cautiously at L.
U. E., cocking gun at port.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> How de dew? (<i>Hood starts and turns. Both
eye each other a moment in silence.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Well?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> I s’pose your my meat.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Can you direct me to the federal headquarters, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>Looking at Hood a moment.</i>) I’ll be darned if
ye hain’t got me. Old Tecump keeps his office on top of his old
white horse most of the time.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> (<i>Pointing R.</i>) I think, sir, in this direction.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Don’t you go there! Johnnies are thicker in
them woods than lunatics in a crazy house. Jest popped one
on ’em, less ’n half an hour ago.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> I have some valuable information for the federal commander.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You git out! Is old Hood got shot?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> I bin wantin’ to light on that old critter’s kerrin
for over a month. If I get a bead on him, Old Secesh is goin’
ter have a fewneral.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> I am very anxious, sir, and no time to lose.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> I bin whoopin’ on that line since daylight. I’m
hungrier than a Floridy allagater.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> (<i>Turning to leave.</i>) I must be moving. Good day,
sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Say! Ye hain’t got nothin’ in yer pocket ter
scald a feller’s in’ards, have ye?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> I regret, sir, that I cannot accommodate you. Good
day, sir. (<i>Attempts to leave R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> If ye stick to me, I’ll get ye there when the relief
comes. When the old general sees you with me, he’ll do the
square thing by ye. I know old Tecump just as well as I do
you. He and I have spilt some fluid since we come down on
this racket. He’s five trumps and four aces in a lone hand every
time you hit him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> You observe I am in the disguise of a rebel general,
to avoid their pickets.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> I wonder if I don’t know skim milk when I
see it?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> If I should be seen in the company of a Yankee, I
should be shot at sight.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Wal, I guess yer head is level on that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> (<i>About to leave—R.</i>) Good day, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Say, I don’t s’pose you’ve got any tobacker in yer
trowsis, have ye?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> (<i>Producing it.</i>) Certainly, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Jest give us a chaw. (<i>Hood complies.</i>) My
stomach is as holler as a collapsed balloon. (<i>Bites off a chew,
and returns plug.</i>) ’Bliged at ye.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> (<i>Turning to go.</i>) Good day, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Say? You jest keep your eye peeled, or them
Johnnies will get your hair. (<i>Exit Hood—R.</i>) That’s a darn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>nice old critter. But I don’t think he’s so bright as some folks,
or else he wouldn’t be caterwaulin’ round here on the picket line
alone. He don’t know nothin’ about war! I’ll be darned if I
don’t think I’ve got stuck some myself. Down east, you can
foller the tellegraff poles. They hain’t got scarcely any on ’em
in this heathen country. This is about the meanest place I ever
travelled in. If I hain’t eat my peck of dirt 250 times since I
hit this land er snakes, you can chaw my ear. I hain’t had a
good square wash for over two years. My hide would raise pertaters
stouter than a down-east cut-down. (<i>Shot from R., and
his hat flies into L. wings.</i>) Gosh all Jewpiter, if that critter
hasn’t spil’t my best hat. (<i>Chasing it out L. Other shots, and
two rebel soldiers creep on R. A shot from L.; one falls, and
the other retreats. Hez. comes on L.</i>) There ain’t no two
Johnnies can drive me. (<i>Feels of the dead rebel.</i>) Bet ye tew
dollars and a half that critter won’t get well. (<i>Exit L. slowly,
looking back often. Brightly creeps on from R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Those Yankee pickets will shoot the rear guard
through the camp yet. (<i>Looking out, R.</i>) Come here. (<i>Enter
Zina, hatless and ragged.</i>) I have spotted you. If you attempt
to escape again, I will shoot you at sight! What are you skulking
around here for?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I was lost; I did not know where I was going.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> You lie! Why do you follow my lieutenant’s
footsteps so much like a cur? You are my property. Not a dog.
What do you hope for? That he will buy you? He can never
do that. Not if his house was solid gold, and he offered me all
he had. White niggers are hard to manage, but I am the man
that never failed on one yet. Look at me! (<i>Zina looks at him
in terror.</i>) If you speak to him again, I will flog your hide off.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, he is all the friend I have in the wide world.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Who feeds your hungry maw and rags your lousy hide?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> When my heart is almost breaking, and I beg for God
to let me die, the kind words he speaks make me hope again so
much—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> In love, hey? A nigger, a field hand, in love with
a gentleman! At least, he passes himself off for one. Within
twelve hours, I will take the pimp out of his proud strut.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, I am such a miserable slave to love so good a master
as he. He is too noble to do a wrong to any one.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> While he has dogged my footsteps when I leave
the camp with you, and has twice incited you to escape?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Heaven is my witness, he <i>did</i> not do that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I will have an end of this! Today he volunteered
to enter the enemy’s camp as a spy—ostensibly as a deserter.
He will be betrayed!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Do with me as you will, and I will never complain;
but he is innocent.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> When he attempts to return, he will be arrested
by the enemy, with the proofs of his business on his person! A
court-martial, an execution, and the end! (<i>Zina in agony.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> My God, what shall I do?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Nothing. (<i>Zina drops on her knees.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, what will you ask of me, and I will never cause
you trouble again?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I make no conditions when I control!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> If I have ever loved anything, it has been lost to me.
(<i>Sinking down, sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Of what use are you to me now? I have taken
insult after insult from <i>him</i>, until I have reached the last. If
this fails, I will kill him!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Springing up.</i>) Then I will tell him the infamous
traitor that you are.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Dashing forward to strike her.</i>) You will?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Defending with stiletto.</i>) Stand off, you cowardly
cur!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Springing back and drawing bowie knife.</i>) Ah
ha, revolt?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Aye, revolt!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Before this, I had determined to kill you. (<i>Rolling
up cuffs, &amp;c.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Who strikes a woman is a coward!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> You have earned your right to the knife now, and
you shall have it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I have worked for you since I could walk, and never
played. You have beat and starved me in return, after I had
done the best I could.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Rant, for this shall be your last time!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Your brutal strength loves best to beat the helpless.
But while I live I will defend myself!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Before my arm—like a breath of heedless air.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> This shall be the last with me. My hands have earned
the right to be free, and now I will be, or you shall kill me!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> This knife shall answer that!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Aye, it shall be to the death for one. But you shall
see how a puny girl shall fight a brutal coward, in defence of her
life and honor!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Your snarling lout shall not protect you this time.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Despair.</i>) God help me and save Master D’Arneaux!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Quickly.</i>) He has already passed the guard!
(<i>Zina starts, chokes, staggers, drops her stiletto and faints. B.
rushes towards her.</i>) I will end these insults here. (<i>A shot
from the L. strikes his arm. He whirls round and dashes out
at R., as Hez. rushes in at L., saying:</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Gosh all hemlock! That’s twice we missed that
critter in the same place. Here I been catawaulin’ round here
for four days, and I hain’t took but thirteen scalps. But I wonder
if we didn’t wade inter them critters yesterday. There is
more cannon balls wasted down in that ar’ medder than you can
stow inter our meetin’ house. Hannah Doolittle! Wan’t there
some glory got loose in that fite! There was more halleluyer
in four minnits than you could twist out er two hundred and fifty

Sal Screwton when she got her fust bussel. (<i>Meantime, enter

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Well?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>Turning, surprised, cocking his gun.</i>) Gosh all
Jewpiter! I thought it was Jeff Davis!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> What have you found?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Guess them critters have gone a fishin’. Hain’t

holler. (<i>Halcom discovers Zina.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> What is this, Hezekiah?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Wall, I’ll be darned if ye hain’t got me. Do ye
s’pose they lay out round here nights?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> (<i>Looking closely.</i>) She sleeps. (<i>Tries to wake
her and fails.</i>) She is unconscious. (<i>Turns her face towards

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Hain’t she handsome?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> She is indeed beautiful! The child is sick, and
perhaps starving. Give me your canteen. (<i>Bathes her face.</i>)
Call some of the pickets. (<i>Bathes still. Hez. goes out L. U.
E., and soon returns with Barney and a stretcher.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Indade now. Do thim blackguards murder beautiful
little girruls like that?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> The child is seriously sick. Take her to my surgeon,
and say it is my desire that every effort shall be made in
her behalf. Handle her carefully. (<i>Hez. and Bar. put her on
the stretcher, raise her tenderly, and bear her out at L. U. E.</i>)
Poor child! She is the victim of brutality, or the hardships of
the front have nearly killed her. (<i>Hesitates.</i>) So much like
my mother’s face! (<i>Bows head. Enter Sherman R. U. E., in
heavy military cloak.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Well, Halcom, have the blues got you again?
(<i>Darken stage gradually.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> General, you must not remain here! We are
within rifle range of the enemy’s pickets. It is exceedingly
dangerous.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> It is growing too dark for sharpshooters to operate.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> The country cannot afford to have you exposed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Pray, why not?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> We are engaged in a desperate march to the sea.
The army is too far from its base to exist without a competent
leader. If you should fall, what next?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Half my men, sir, are fit to command.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> General, you are too sanguine of the capabilities
of others. I repeat again, you <i>must</i> be careful. The safety of
the army demands it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Halcom, you are too anxious for the safety of every
one but yourself. The army has a common impression that
you are the most daring, reckless officer at the front.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> It matters but little if I fall.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Why, my dear sir, your life—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Is worth nothing for myself. If it please heaven
that I live to see a full and earnest liberty here, with all the
stars of the old flag still lingering there, it matters little what
becomes of me.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Halcom, I never see you smile! There is some
terrible misfortune hidden behind your sad, melancholy face, you
have never yet revealed. Desperate; rash; impetuous; you
have won your double stars at twenty-eight. A brilliant military
dash that thrills the army; and you fell back so quietly to
the seclusion of your quarters, and never seem to hope or look
for reward. But for this, your life has been a blank to me.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> There is nothing in the history of my family I
could wish to conceal.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> I have looked in vain for its justification, while I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>have observed in you a seeming too sanguinary hate of our misguided
countrymen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> I have sometimes thought that I may be insane
from the wrongs I have suffered from the men who lead this revolt.
Not thirty leagues from here I first saw the light. My
family came of the Huguenot emigrants that settled in the Carolinas.
As the rush of population swept towards the west
my ancestors found a home in the wilds of Tennessee. My father
inherited twenty thousand acres in the Cumberland Valley.
Our home was happy. My angel mother was a friend to the
helpless and wronged. At twelve years of age I kissed her the
last good bye (<i>hesitating</i>), and left to educate myself in the free
schools of New England. My father was no traitor to the
principles of right and justice. Accused of no overt act, he
had the right to advocate his convictions, and these were so
born and educated in right, infamy had no manly response.
The knife and torch of the assassin met his appeal to the honor
of his adversaries. One day a dispatch came to me. I hurriedly
broke the seal. They had all perished by the hand of the
assassin. Five weeks later I awoke from the delirium of a fever
that has never left my brain. (<i>Shows Sherman a picture.</i>)
My mother. She was so good and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> She was, indeed, beautiful (<i>returns it</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Kneeling in my New England home, with her sweet
face looking from that picture into my own, I swore that my
hand should never stay, until it should find the life of her assassin.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Such revenge is honorable.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> An infant sister was born during my absence—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> She still lives?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Her ashes mingle with the others in the ruins of
our old home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Only the class that can buy and sell human hearts
and affections can produce such villains.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Fifteen years since I have made my annual pilgrimage
to the desolate spot where I was born. A tablet to
their memory survives until I leave. Often in disguise I have entered
the councils of my enemies. Seven of the fiends I have
looked in the face, while my hands clutched their throats till
the last gurgle of life had been gone an hour. The chief still
survives. I have tracked him through the gambling hells and
slave yards of the southern cities, till I have found him in command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>of a guerilla force in this department. Twice I have
seemed to annihilate them, but he has never appeared among
the slain.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Be careful, Halcom. You must not peril your
life for so worthless an object. Your military fame is the
property of the country. You peril this for a chance at a dog.
When your division assaults the works of the enemy tomorrow,
I urge it as a claim of your country, that you shall not needlessly
expose yourself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> So much will I as becomes a soldier who would
defend his country from such assassins. If I fall, let me sleep
in my old home in the soil of Tennessee, whose honor I have
tried to defend against the cowards who have dragged her into
this infamous revolt.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> (<i>Taking his hand.</i>) Well said, my boy. You
will not fall. God will protect the brave hearts that are to save
the home he has made for the poor. I have gazed in wonder
and surprise so many times on the brave fellows that sprang so
wildly to the front, before the echoes of Sumter’s cannon had
hardly died away among the free hills of the north. Half of
them fit to be governors or presidents! What a people have
sprung from the little squad that first planted civil liberty on old
Plymouth Rock. Brave old New England! How quickly her
sword leaped from the scabbard when slavery struck at this.
How the offshoots of her brain throb and flash across the prairies
of the great west. How her freedom and little church spires
cling to the hills as her civilization marches for the western sea!
It is God’s advance guard leading the way to a larger and freer
home for the poor. Think, Halcom, of the glory that is coming.
The star is in the west now. Fifty years hence a hundred millions
of free and prosperous people will offer thanksgiving to
heaven for this, your sword shall help so much to win.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> It is indeed beautiful to contemplate. But there
are bitter cups for many to drain before that glory comes. I
hope for nothing. My family are gone. When my heart reaches
out for my kindred, it remembers only that the assassin has
left nothing to love but the ashes of the old home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Let us pursue this painful subject no longer. Go
and sleep now. Howard tells me you are watching forever.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> You will expect us to carry the left redoubts at
daybreak?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> If heaven wills.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> The men will do all you may expect. Listen for
my cannon at daybreak.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> At daybreak?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> At daybreak. (<i>Hal. salutes and retires R. U. E.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> The bravest and most honorable man I ever saw! So
young to command. (<i>Turns to leave L.U.E., meets Hez. entering.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Hold on there, you old gunpowder guzzler, you
come here and give me the password or I’ll blow you out er
water. I will, by jingo!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> (<i>To rear centre slowly.</i>) Atlanta.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>Scratching head and thinking.</i>) I’ll be darned
ter Moses ef I don’t think that is the password arter all. My
memory wants joggin, wuss ’n Ike Acorn’s cabbages that was
planted in a sandbank coz ’twas easy hoin’.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Are you on the regular picket tonight?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> I’ll be darned if ye hain’t got me. I bin catawaulin
round here all day ter get a pop at some er them Johnnies,
and Barney brings out the provender.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Do you know the general-in-chief, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Well, I should think I ought ter. He and I
have drinked over a barrel together since this rumpus come up.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> How do you like the service, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Now you’ve hit me where I bile over. When the
fightin’ fust commenced, I thought I wan’t no great shakes er
gettin’ shot for thirteen dollars a month, till one day one er them
bumbshells come along and peeled the whole hind eend of my
trowsers off. That made me madder than a kicked hornet. I
just got a bead on my old shooter, and I let her sliver right into
um. I shouldn’t wonder if I killed thirty or forty er them darn
skunks. I had four fingers and a half in that gun.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Quite a good beginning, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Ye see when I get my dander up something has
got to come, or bust. How long do you suppose the old general
is goin’ ter keep us out here killin’ them critters? I’d jest
like ter give him a piece er my brains on that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Well, sir, what would you do to make the machine
work faster?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Well, I should pizen their grub. You tell him
that and I shouldn’t wonder ef he’d dew it. They say he’s a
dam rough old critter; but he can spile more Jersey pizen
than any other critter this side er sundown. Say, how long
have you been in this machine?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> About thirty years, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You git out! Why you must be chock full er
bullets by this time. I spose you’d feel kinder lonesome if ye
didn’t have two or three pounds on ’em in ye all the time. I
like ter had the daylights knocked out er me yesterday. One er
them bumbshells struck a tree jest over my head, when I was
fodderin’ up, and it sp’ilt forty cents’ worth er vittles for me in
less than two minnits. If that bumbshell had hit jest seventeen
inches lower, Sal. Rideout would er bin out jest my figger exactly.
I quit eatin’ then, and went inter my tent to fix up my
shirt collar, so if I got shot, I would lay out handsome, and who
do you s’pose I see crawlin’ under the back er the general’s tent,
when the guard wan’t lookin’?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> I have not the least idea, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> A dam sneakin’ skunk of a rebel, with a knife
in his mouth. When I got in there, he tried ter hide under the
general’s bunk. The way I placed that old hob-nailed cowhide
under the lower eend er his jacket, would er upset a meetin’-house.
I’ll be darned if that critter didn’t up and snap a pistol
right in my face. I jest laid down my gun, and if I didn’t plow
and harrer his anatomy, you can dig me out for a hog’s trough,
and kiss me for his mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> What became of the man, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> I jist wasted him all over half an acre, fore he
got away. (<i>Hez. suddenly stops and presses his hand on his
belly, doubling up.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> What is the matter, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> It’s my old colic comin’ agin. I got ter go and
git a gin sling. (<i>Dashes his gun in Sherman’s hands, knocking
him half down.</i>) Jest hold my old shooter. (<i>Dashes out
at L.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Hold on, sir. Here! Halt, you scoundrel! (<i>Recovering
his feet.</i>) Gone? Confound that idiot. I will have
him court-martialed for leaving his post. (<i>Thinking.</i>) Then I
should be shown up for allowing the fool to impose upon me.
The general of the army on guard! I shall be the laughing
stock of the whole army. I’ll wage my commission that he made
that to get off for a drink. I’ll scare the idiot out of his senses
when he returns. Here he comes. Halt, sir! Stand there till
I call the officer of the guard. Move if you dare, sir, and you
are a dead man! (<i>Hez. walks up and takes the gun away, saying—</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You git out. If you don’t know me, you’re the
biggest puddin’ head in the country!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> You are the most impudent scoundrel I ever met.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>Handing money.</i>) Here’s a quarter for ye. Now
you go home and put that knowledge box er your’n under a gardeen,
or somebody’ll shoot you for a stray mule.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> You are an idiot, sir!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>Throwing hat, coat and gun down, L.</i>) I don’t
take that from nobody.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Hold on, sir! What are you going to do?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Goin’ ter trample on your constitushun about
four minnits. (<i>Turns to attack, and meets Sherman’s revolver.</i>)
Lay down that shooter, I’ll give ye four dollars.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> I am a gentleman, sir, no ruffian.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Glad ye told me, I shouldn’t er known it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> You want to fight, sir, do you? You shall have
all you desire, sir!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Then peel and prong round here.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> I will meet you here at sunset, tomorrow, sir, for
a duel. Arms, broadaxes! Then I will kill you, sir, like a dog.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> How much do you weigh when you’re all bloated
up?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> I am known as the worst man in the west, sir!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Nobody would look at ye and dispute it. If I
looked as bad as you do, I’d hold my breath till I died. I chawed
up twenty-seven men once, with a common axe. When I wade
in with a broadaxe—wall, you get your friends to come down
and hunt up the corpse in about fourteen seconds after they say
time.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Do you stop to bury your dead, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Now you git out. (<i>Picking up coat.</i>) If the old
general should come along and find me talkin’ to you, he’d raise
all possess about it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> (<i>Turning to R. to leave.</i>) Remember, sir, tomorrow
at sunset. I trust that you are no coward that will
waste my time, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Don’t you fret. Fore I get through with ye,
you’ll think a meetin’-house has fell down on ye. (<i>Exit Sherman,
R. Hez. puts on his clothes.</i>) Spose that critter will
come, or was he blowin’? I don’t think I’m healthy! I ain’t
no ’count with a broadaxe! (<i>Enter Sally, R. U. E., in male attire,
face covered by a wide-rimmed hat.</i>) Hello, there, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>padded up young scallawag! What are you catawaulin’ after,
out here?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) He won’t know me.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Come putty near shootin’ you for a stray calf.
Bin more corpses carried off er this beat since I bin on, than a
hoss can haul.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> (<i>Approaching sideways, with hat over her eyes.</i>)
Come putty near shootin’, did ye? You gaunt, hamstrung old
spavin!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You’d er bin a corpse now, if I hadn’t took you
for a mule.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> I would, hey? You old collapse, you!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> If you should strain hard, do you spose you could
tell whose fool has broke loose?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> That is an insult I won’t swallow!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Who told ye too?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> (<i>Bristling up.</i>) I will have blood for that! Blood,
sir! R. R. (<i>As Hez. turns to L. she dashes out R. and hides.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> If I don’t (<i>turns to L. to throw off hat and coat.</i>)
collapse your constertushun, I hope I may rot. (<i>Turning, he
finds she has disappeared.</i>) There’ll be two or three fewnerals
round here bime by. (<i>Looks out L. U. E.</i>) There comes a
Johnny! (<i>Hides, L. Brightly enters cautiously, L. U. E. As
he works along towards R. U. E., Hez. creeps up behind, and
pounces on him, throwing him down. They tussle all about the

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scene 2.</span> <i>Landscape and Wood. Centre.</i></h3>

<p class='c010'>(<i>Enter Sherman and Halcom, at L. U. E., and go to R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> I am about to attempt the capture of Atlanta by
a flank movement. I wish you to throw your Division forward
and occupy that ridge on the right of the railway. I have ordered
twelve batteries to protect you from an enfilade. The position,
you see, covers the line of his communications. The successful
accomplishment of this will probably compel Hood to
evacuate his strong positions and fall back. I give you the position
of honor because you do not fail.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Thank you!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Once clear of this line of entrenchments, we have
them in the open country before us. (<i>Enter Hez. L. U. E.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Say, General. We have just took the darndest,
rantankerest piece er rebel meat you ever put your eyes on.
He’s got more red pepper in his constertewshun than a Boston
wholesale grocery store. He’s wus’n them hyennys in Barnum’s
circus! Had ter tie the darn critter ter keep him from chawin’
up everybody. Don’t ye know, that critter had cheek enough
ter walk right over my beat, jest as if I want there. I jest laid
down my gun, and if I didn’t hop onter his kerrin, you can
chaw my ear.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Did you notice his rank, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Wal, I did think he was a little rank when I got
through with him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> I mean, sir, did you notice if he was an officer?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> I never thought ter ask him ’bout that. He tumbled
so fast. I had ter hump ter keep up. Why, he’s the same
feller I see trying ter crawl under Frank’s tent.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Who is Frank, sir?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Jehosafat! Don’t you know Frank?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> I think not, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>Pulling Halcom to the front.</i>) There is jest
the handsomest piece er furnicher this side er sundown.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Why, you rascal, that is General Halcom.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You git out! That’s our Frank.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Look here, sir, you were on guard last night.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>Looking at Sherman, and then aside.</i>) Jewrusalem!
That was the old Gineral I run into last night. Now
I’ve gone and spilt the apple sass all over the best table cloth.
(<i>Turns and grasps Sherman’s hands.</i>) How de dew? I know’d
that was you last night, all the time. Ain’t I the wust blackguard
you ever run into?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Bring in that prisoner, sir. I will deal with you
when there is less business on hand.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>Attempting to leave.</i>) Jess you say. I spose
you boss this cahoot. (<i>Turns back.</i>) Say, you keep your eye
peeled. He’s a darn pizen critter. He may try to get your
guzzle. (<i>Exit Hez. L.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Is that man insane or a fool?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Neither. He is one of the rough diamonds of the
army: the very first man I enlisted in the old Bay State. Brave
as a lion, and keen as a razor.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Why, the rascal would have thrashed me blind
last night, but for my revolver.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Indeed! His patriotism drifts only in the rudeness
of its native channel. I put up with his familiarities, because
he cannot understand the necessity for military etiquette.
(<i>Crosses to L. front. Enter Hez. and Barney, L. U. E., driving

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> (<i>To Hez.</i>) Untie his hands. (<i>Hez. unties, &amp;c.</i>)
Sir, I hear that you have been arrested as a spy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I am a prisoner of war.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Now I remember—you have once before been

when both start from recognition.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> The assassin of my family!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Of whom do you speak?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Yourself, coward!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Then you may consider yourself a liar!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> (<i>To Sherman.</i>) During the last fifteen years, I
have hunted this brute through the slave yards and gambling
hells of the south. Now he shall answer to me. You shall meet

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>To Sherman.</i>) Am I to be murdered while a

all you desire. (<i>Brightly seizes the knife from the floor, and

no difference to you, I’d like ter make this critter inter a stuffed

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> I said remove him, and I hold you responsible if
he escapes!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> For a pinsion!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Gittin’ rich, wasn’t ye?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> To be sure I was. Wasn’t I ingaged to Biddy
Maloney? Didn’t she have a peanut store on the sidewalk and
a suit of rooms in Tim Sullivan’s cellar? Didn’t she fail four
times in one summer and pay ten cints? Ah’r, the smart girl
she is! With a gal like that, what is the need er workin’?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Say, Barney, how would you like to be a Jigadier
Brindle?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> What, one er them fellers with brass things on ’em?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> I have ambishun like that. Then I could go to the
hospittle when the whiskey makes me sick, and be kapin’ out
of the fight. (<i>Trying to see something on Barney’s back, when
Barney turns back to the audience. As he does, Hez. says—</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Ye know how to protect yer rear. (<i>Lifts Barney’s
coat tail, and exhibits a black patch as large as a chair bottom,

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> (<i>Swelling with rage.</i>) I do that! I’m a jintleman!
No blackguard! I poke no fun to make a laugh on a jintleman!
Whin a blackguard attacks me reputation, I don’t care what he
says! When he puts his dirty hands on my karrackter, I will
resint it like a man! I’m an Irishman, and me honor’s me own!
I have no cheap words with a blackguard without the iddication
of a jintleman! I am no thafe to be spit upon! Come out!
Come out! (<i>Motioning towards R. U. E.</i>) Come out! (<i>Hez.
hands a bottle towards him. Barney catches sight of it as he
says—</i>) Come—(<i>Breaks down in a broad grin.</i>) What kind er
wather is that?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Medicine for fits. (<i>Barney drinks.</i>) Old Deacon
Jones took about a quart er that once, by mistake. Said
he thought the whole neighborhood was a jewsharp, and he was
playin’ on it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> ’Pon my word!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Know’d of a feller in Shadagy, that was brought
up on that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> That same?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Yes sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> How long was he doin’ that?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> He grow’d so long they couldn’t tax him when
he was twenty-one.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> How was the blackguard gettin’ by that?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> They considered the most of him was out er the
county. (<i>Sally enters R. in male attire. Steps between them

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Darn your picter!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> The angels were lookin’!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You tell him he’s a liar!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> (<i>To Hez.</i>) It’s some poor thing that’s crazy from

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Yes, we know’ you’re a big ingin. (<i>Offers her a
bottle.</i>) Have some firewater? (<i>Sally takes and pockets bottle.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> So has the dignity of my mission been insulted: you
shall die now! Cowards, you have two minutes to live! Take
off your hats and coats. (<i>Both comply.</i>) It were unworthy
for you to die in the Union blue! One minute more! (<i>Holds

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Stop! Will you take two months pay?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> How long shall I be insulted thus?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Have you ever bin a father or mother?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Yes sir. Have you bin that?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> I’ll hear no more! (<i>Looking at watch.</i>) Five seconds

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You git out! Where ye get them close?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Hez., after you went away, I couldn’t eat nor sleep
for fourteen weeks.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You don’t?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Fact! Then my best hen and the old cat died, and
I jest thought I should go crazy. Then Bill Larkins ’listed for
a sutler, and I was mad all over. After you left, that scallawag
was preachin’ treason all the time, till he found he could be a
sutler. He’s bin <i>ravin’</i> for rebel blood ever since. A man jest
told me that Bill bought a bad barrel er vinnegar for half a dollar—made
it into eighteen barrels er cider, and sold it all out to
the regiment for ten cents a glass!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> I thought I smelt vinegar awful strong when I
was over there t’other day!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> You jest wait for the next Pordunk Cultivater! If
I don’t chaw him up!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You jest wait till I get home and light on him
again!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Ye see when Bill Larkins done that, I said I would
get some men’s clothes and ’list myself! When it come round
ter bein’ examined by the doctor, I had ter back out. Then I
jest went and hired out on the Perdunk Cultivater.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Sal, I never’s so proud on ye ’fore in my life.
Yer jest handsum!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Now you get out, Hez. You’re soapin?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> On’er bright?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Oh, yer ought ter see me in my new dress, Hez. I
had it made after you left. Oh, my! It’s got a tail to it more’n
four feet long! Pashe Milliken made it. She got the pattern
of Butrick in Boston. It’s a stunner! Got a flummux all over
the hind part of it. But Pashe beat me on one thing, though.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> How’d she do that?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Ye see they have to put in somethin’ behind here, to
make ’em swell. Pashe told me it was stuffin’. One day I heard
a crumplin’, and I ripped open the linen to see what it was.
Don’t yer think, that hump was swell’d up with old Pordunk
Cultivators!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You git out!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> When I get home, I’m jest goin’ ter lay fer her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Say, Sal. I s’pose ye got that dress ter git married
in, didn’t ye?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Ye don’t s’pose I’d spread like that jest for a go-ter-meetin’
dress, do ye?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Cost six dollars?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Six dollars! It cost eight, beside the pattern; that
was one er the best ones Butrick had.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You get out!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Oh, wan’t Hannah Doolittle jealous! Such a tail
draggin’ in the street. She said she wouldn’t have one if it was
give to her. Her pink caliker cost ninety cents.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Say, Sal. I bin lonesomer than a stray ghost,
I ain’t seen you for so long. Tell us all about what’s goin’ on
ter home. Has Ike Spaulding shingled his woodshed yet?
What’s come of Preposterous Perkins and Mercy Ann Stubbs?
S’pose they’ve got a whole family by this time.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> (<i>Covering her face.</i>) Now, Hez., ain’t you ’shamed
er yourself!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Has Suke Peabody and old Inkhorn tied up yet?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Course they have.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Suke don’t care any more for that old mummy,
than she does for our old farrer cow. She jest wants ter get her
fingers in on his money, then she’ll pizen him ter death in less’n
a week. If she don’t she’s got more endurance than a mule.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Ain’t he soft on her, though?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Soft? You can stab him with a cat’s tail, and
not ruffle a feather. (<i>A shot from R.</i>) Jehosafat! Them Johnnies
are comin’. Let’s get out. (<i>Attempts to push her out, L.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> (<i>Drawing knife and revolver.</i>) Hold on, Hez. Let
me get a lick at them fellers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>Pushing her out L.</i>) You get out! You do
no nothin’ about war. (<i>Disappears L. Enter rebel soldiers R,

Halcom, R. U. E.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Keele Brightly, your last hour is close at hand. I
have not intruded myself to torture you with recriminations. I
yield my right to the law of military necessity. I come because
I have been moved to pity by that heart-broken child lying at
the outer guard, begging so piteously to see the last man she
ought to love or respect. I have at last obtained permission for
her to see you, immediately preceding your execution. I have
come to ask you to forget the brute, and give her one kind word
before you die. All night long and yesterday, through the rain
and cold, shelterless, and refusing food, she sat by the door,
waiting for your coming. Her piteous pleadings for your worthless
life, when the General returned from the front, would have
melted a heart of stone. How have you repaid her life of devotion?
She has never known father or mother. A generous
heart must love something! Within an hour she will be out in
the world, worse than an orphan. Who is she? She was not
born a slave. You sought a groundless revenge. Are you not
satisfied? My mother’s face lives in hers! (<i>Breaks down.</i>) If
any one of my family live—looking God in the face—speak!
Have you nothing to say?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Nothing!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> May God have mercy on you who never had any,
when it was so easy to give. (<i>Exit Halcom, R, looking back
twice, as if expecting B. to relent.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> (<i>To Brightly.</i>) Did you mind that talkin’? (<i>B.
silent.</i>) Hey? Jist one hour, says the Gineral, and you will
be an orfin. If you make yourself a dam fool like that, you may
be two orfins! (<i>Zina dashes in at R. U. E.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Master D’Arneaux! (<i>Drops on her knee.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Turned away.</i>) Sh—do not recognize me. (<i>Giving
his hand behind, as Barney paces to R.</i>) Are there any
means of escape?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Shying key into Brightly’s hands.</i>) This will unfasten
your irons. I have removed the outer fastening on the
window. It will open at your touch. When the back of the
guard is turned, unlock your irons. The river runs close by.
You are safe if you reach the other side. When I seize the
guard, spring through the window and make for the river. (<i>B.
drops on his knees as if in meditation. Zina kneels and leans
her head on his shoulder. As Barney turns to R, she springs
on his back like a tiger, locking her arm across his throat,

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> A most marvelous escape! The poor child is excused

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, sir, I did not mean to do wrong. Please say you
do not hate me for that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> I do not. Your heroic impulsiveness for one you
believed to be your friend, excites only my admiration, though
so disastrous to you, as well as myself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, I try so hard to do right. (<i>Sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Do not feel so bad; the past can never be helped.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Though he is so bad, I ought to love my master. Perhaps,
when the war is over, I can do something to make him a
better man. Oh, you will not think bad of me, I have so little
to love. (<i>Sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Zina, why do you try to love the man who holds
your life in a bondage more hateful than death? Who has returned
your devotion with nothing but misery, destitution, and
the most servile submission. Who would sell your soul and
body to dishonor, without one pang of regret. An assassin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>thief, coward, ruffian; who blights virtue and crushes the honest
aspirations and civil rights of all he touches.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh please, master, do not speak like that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> You have no master but God.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, I do not know what to do.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> There is some dark mystery covers your early life.
You are not of the race whose brain and life have been crushed
in the ignorance of slavery since this Republic began. Something
tells me your life was born in wrong. The brain of the
Anglo-Saxon—the white skin of another nation—the quick intelligence
and sublime conceptions of the northern blood, betray
the lie that binds you to a life like this.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, I do not know what I am.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> But God says through your angel face, and the
heavenly music in your soul, that your life was not born for this.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, my life is so hopeless—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Do you remember your mother?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I had no mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> No mother?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I grew up among the hands; I know nothing more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> You had but one master?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Master Brightly is all I have ever known.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> They have told you nothing of your origin?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> You have no little keepsake in memory of the past!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> (<i>Breaking down.</i>) My God! There is a history
here the earth must have. Give it to me, and I will be content.
(<i>Drops head.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Rising and looking at him earnestly.</i>) Mistress
D’Arneaux has told me of a good God in heaven who gave us
the beautiful earth and flowers, who loves even the broken hearts
of the poor and helpless, whose hand leads always to happiness
and truth, whose justice is as the rocks and mountain cliffs of
our old home, that are never moved. But this is not for the
slave, for master beats his hands so cruelly when they have tried
to do the best they could.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> It is not the fault of heaven that men are bad. As
justice lives for all, so is there a counterpoise of wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, my master has told me nothing of what you say.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Away back in the almost hidden past, there lived
a man whose mission was to substitute love for brutality. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>laid down his life for this. The same wrong that renders your
life hopeless, crushed his. Almost 1900 years have passed since
then, but the silent hand of the dead still lives in the better civilization
of the north.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, I have thought so much, and looked in hope for
better days to come, but it has been so hopeless. (<i>Halcom
looks earnestly at her.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> How would you like to come with me?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh, you have been so good to me—but—but Master
D’Arneaux will buy me when the war is done. Oh, his hands
are so happy—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> You are right, my little one. Master D’Arneaux
is a better man than I.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh no, I did not mean that. But—but I know Master
D’Arneaux so well. If it wasn’t that I know Master D’Arneaux
so well, I—I would go with you.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Right, right.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Did—did you have a mother?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> A long time ago. (<i>Turns away.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Master D’Arneaux had a mother, and he is so good to
his help. Do you feel bad because I said that?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Why, my little one?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> You always look at me so strangely. Oh, I do not
know what to say to you then.</p>

<p class='c011'>H. Your face brings back to me so many memories of the past.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I am so sorry I made you feel so bad. Does your
mother live in the north?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> She is dead!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh I am so sorry she is dead. She must have been
such a good mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> She was indeed good, and beautiful as yourself.
(<i>Advances, kisses her forehead and turns away. Enter Sherman,
L. U. E.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> What, that little rebel owl again?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Prattling of the incongruous things of life, like the
child she is.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> The jade! I suppose she would assist that scoundrel
she calls her master, if she could.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> She asks me to intercede with you, that she may
go back to her old home again.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> And concoct some scheme of assassination with
that brute who has escaped.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Please let me go to my home. (<i>Drops on knee.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> (<i>Sharply.</i>) You will remain.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> She is an innocent, artless child, General.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Artless? She is a devil! During her master’s
escape, she held the guard with the ferocity of a tiger, while he
took his leisure to leave. Had she been a man, I would
have had her shot at once. Orderly, here! (<i>Enter Orderly,
L. U. E.</i>) Take this girl to the care of the guard again. Say
to the officer in charge, it shall go bad if she is allowed to stray
again. (<i>Orderly seizes her arm roughly and leads her away, L. U. E.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> (<i>To Orderly.</i>) Tenderly my boy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> In war, women are devils, and you can’t strike
back. I can confine all but their tongues. They shall rant the
empty air with them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hal.</span> Certainly, General, her childish years must be harmless.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Do you shut your eyes to the fact that she is only
here as a spy?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Why, she is a mere child, General.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> A very old child, with fifty years of a woman’s
cunning in her head.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Certainly you jest.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Female spies may remain in this camp without
harm. If they leave it, I am to blame for it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Why General, you see an enemy everywhere.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Young man, you seem to have an unusual interest
in that girl. Remember, this is war. No time for love and
moonshine.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Why, she is scarcely fifteen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Old enough to absorb this love looney that distresses
incipient womanhood so much. (<i>Rapid firing at R.
Both bring their field glasses to bear, and look out.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> A sortie in front of my division. (<i>Springs out R.
Enter man with field telegraph, L.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Order five batteries from the Chief of Artillery
to the ridge on the right of the attack. Open at once. Tell
Schofield to shift his reserves to Howard’s support at once.
(<i>Firing gradually increases.</i>) Here comes the Artillery! Halcom
can never stop that charge! Tell McClernard to double-quick.
They will be overpowered. My God! The whole rebel
army is upon him! This is a surprise! What have the advance
guard been doing? A splendid charge, McClernard, on
my honor. (<i>Enter Orderly excitedly, R. U. E.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span><span class='sc'>Orderly.</span> Gen. Halcom is wounded and a prisoner!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Orderly, my horse! (<i>To Operator.</i>) Order a
double-quick advance all along the line. Order Kilpatrick to
attack their right with all the cavalry. Tell Schofield the double
stars to the first Brigadier inside the enemy’s works.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Orderly.</span> (<i>Entering L. U. E.</i>) Your horse, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Operator.</span> Orders all right, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> (<i>To Operator.</i>) Now move to the hill on the
right of the attack. (<i>Sherman springs into the saddle and gallops
off, R. Ord. and Operator leave R. U. E. Firing recedes.

tells you, go home and behave yourself, you would fight about
that, would ye? You don’t know Abe Linken, I guess. He
would bat the divil out of ye. He told me to shoot any blackguards
lookin’ as bad as ye. Do you mind that? Have you got
any bottles in your pockets? You h’aint? (<i>Prepares to shoot,
when all rush up, and each gives him a bottle.</i>) Don’t you stop
like that again, or I bat you. You don’t know Bin Butler? I
guess you don’t. You better give four dollars you don’t. He
would break your damn heads off ye. (<i>Pointing L.</i>) Walk that

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> (<i>Feeling of her arms, &amp;c.</i>) I wonder if I’m broke

<p class='c011'>Now that Zina don’t know which side she is on. But she’s a

bluest thing out of a grave yard. By gorry, I ain’t goin’ ter die
till the time comes. I went over ter see her yesterday, and she
was down on the floor cryin’, and she didn’t know what for. The
old General thinks she’s got the devil in her. If she has, he’s
an awful mild one. Sometimes you could knock her down with
a feather. The old General don’t like women. He’s the first
man er that kind I ever see. Poor little Zina, she’s always in
trouble. When she heard General Halcom was took, she was
jist crazy. In less’n two hours she was missing, and the guard
don’t know how. I’ll bet ye tew dollars that girl is off for a fuss,
or else things is deceivin’. If I was going ter give any advice,
I should say, that anything that weighs less than a ton, had better
get off the track. (<i>Firing away to R.</i>) By gorry, there’s

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scene 2.</span> <i>Night.</i> Thunder storm rising. Flashes of lightning in the distance. Heavy forest back. A river running through at rear, half hidden among the trees. A flat-roofed log hut in rear centre. A hole cut in the roof 2½ feet square, near front, and covered with short boards nailed at one end, and so weakened by hewing that a woman’s strength might be able to break them. A rope fastened overhead, where it would dangle over rear of hut, then guyed to hang over the hole, and drawn up out of sight. A door at R. end of hut, and bar behind it. (<i>Gen. Halcom disc. asleep on the floor of the hut, wounded in the head. A rebel sentry pacing outside the door.</i>)</h3>

<p class='c010'>(<i>Enter Gen. Hood, Keele Brightly, D’Arneaux, and others, R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> General, I have called your attention to this matter
at midnight, because the circumstances admit of no delay.
In yonder cabin a Major General of the union army is confined
as a prisoner of war. He owes allegiance, and is a native of
the state of Tennessee. As a traitor to his native state, I would
suggest that he be tried at once by a drum-head court-martial,
and shot as he deserves.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Why so urgent?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> The federals are rapidly forcing our positions.
He might be recaptured. It would be a direful calamity if he
should escape.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> He is but one man against us.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> A hundred men, sir. A devil, without restraint.
It was his division that first broke our lines at Lookout Mountain.
That robbed us of our victory at Chickamauga. His men
are goaded to fight like devils, while he plunges into the thickest
of the fight, hewing his way through the men as if they were
dummies.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Such bravery merits our consideration.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> For a traitor?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Yes, sir, for a traitor. Though he wears the traitor’s
garb, he is still one of the iron hearts of Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> It is this deference to treason that disheartens
the army. The south swarms with men who opposed secession.
The coast clear, and they will fight against us. To keep these
traitors where they belong, the patriotic men of the army demand
an example. Refuse, and the foot of the northern tyrant
will be on our necks within the next year. As the commander
of the finest army in the south, I do not believe you will disappoint
them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Let the prisoner be brought forth.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Sentinel, the Commander-in-Chief would speak
with the prisoner at once. (<i>Sentinel unlocks the door, and
kicks Halcom to wake him. He springs to his feet.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Well, what next? (<i>Sentinel points to the door,
and Halcom passes out, &amp;c.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> You are a native of Tennessee?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Well?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> What do you mean by well?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Interpret to suit yourself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> It has been represented that you are a traitor to your
native state.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Undoubtedly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Do you deny it?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Who is my accuser?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> An assassin and ravisher of defenceless women!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Liar!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> A coward, who covers his tracks with the knife
and torch!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> A traitor accuses me!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> A blatant ruffian, who fights only when no danger
steps in his way. (<i>Brightly draws to attack him. Hood steps
between.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Enough of this.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Leave him to his way.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> You were captured yesterday—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> While insensible from wounds.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> While fighting against your native state.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> To save her honor.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> By virtue of treason.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Who are you that speaks of treason?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> A soldier who never forgets his obligations to the soil
that gave him heritage.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Whose sword is dishonored with blighted virtue
and broken hearts, bartered for gold in the shambles of the auction
yards.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Keep your foul tongue civil, or I may forget myself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> It is honorable to be a traitor, when allegiance
would strangle liberty—outrage virtue—rob the poor of the right
to their miserable earnings, and trample on the most sacred affections
of the heart.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> The defence of a hypocrite.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Only cowards defend dishonor. (<i>Brightly draws,
and attempts to rush on him. D’A. dashes between.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. The man is unarmed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Which leaves him no right to convey an insult.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Call a court-martial at once. The military law shall
settle this. (<i>Brightly hurries out, R.</i>) D’Arneaux, search his
person for arms. (<i>D’A. makes a fruitless search. Enter Brightly
with a drum and camp-stool, followed by a rebel officer.</i>)
Col. Gilday, you will act as judge advocate. (<i>Gilday prepares
for business.</i>) Capt. Brightly, take the stand. (<i>Sworn.</i>) State
to the court what you know of this man.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> The prisoner’s name is Francis Halcom. He is a
native of Creelsboro’, Tennessee, on the Cumberland river. I
have known the family since my childhood. With the exception
of three years in Massachusetts for education, Creelsboro’
has always been his home. When Tennessee withdrew from the
confederation, he immediately went north, raised troops, and has
since led them on to pillage and murder in his native state. Yesterday,
he was captured with arms in his hands, fighting as becomes
a traitor. (<i>Steps aside.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> D’Arneaux, take the stand. (<i>Sworn.</i>) Tell the
court what you know of this case.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. I am acquainted with all the facts related by Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Brightly. In addition, while the prisoner was absent in Massachusetts,
his family was assassinated, and home burned, on account
of political differences. When the war broke out, he was
exiled for the same reason.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> You would defend this murderer?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Justice demands <i>all</i> the facts.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Which palliate nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Had the assassin destroyed my family, and deprived
me of my civil rights in the name of the state, <i>I too would have
been a traitor!</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Leave your sword at my headquarters, and consider
yourself under arrest. Step aside.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. I wash my hands of this murder about to be consummated.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Go to your quarters, sir. I command here. (<i>D’A.
leaves slowly. To Halcom.</i>) You have heard the evidence
against you—what have you to say?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Of what use is a defence in such a court as this?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> The court will hear an excuse, even.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> The principal evidence is guilty of the murder of
my family.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I demand that he shall be made to prove that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> The closing of my life saves his.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I demand an end of this cant.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> I will hold him responsible for every word he speaks.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Who speaks of responsibility? The history of today
is yet to be written. When it is, a page will be given to
the infamy of the leaders of this revolt. Two thousand years
of the world’s best civilization tramples with disdain on the barbarisms
for which you contend. Justice, Christianity and manhood
alike repudiate the dishonor your sword sustains. What
is treason? (<i>Pointing to B.</i>) To defend my country against
such reptiles as that!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Will the court listen to this croaking liar longer?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Leave him to his falsehoods. They but invite the
bullet still more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Most wise judge! How evenly are the scales of
justice balanced in your court! How commendable are the tales
that suit the judge! How villainously disgusting are the defensive
presumptions of the prisoner, that might so basely impugn
the intentions of the court!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Who hatches crime, will defend a lie!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Who subverts justice, is a traitor to God!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Let the bullet settle this at once.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> (<i>To the court.</i>) Gentlemen of the court, you have
heard the evidence. Is the prisoner guilty?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>All.</span> Aye, guilty!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Captain Brightly, return the prisoner to the cabin.
He will be allowed fifteen minutes to prepare. You will then
call a squad of men, and see to it that he is shot to the death.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Gen. Hood, I request that I may die by the hand
of a brave and honorable man.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> So I have decreed!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> His hands are tainted with the murder of defenceless
women.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> ’Tis false!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> So is he a coward! Twice I have thrown my knife
at his feet to defend himself against my empty hands, and he
has refused!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>To Hood.</i>) Do you believe the falsehoods of a
traitor?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Then be it so now!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> (<i>To Brightly.</i>) Well?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I will not risk a life that may be of use to my
country, in a duel with a man who has been condemned to death
for treason.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Well said, sir! Sentinel, remand the prisoner. (<i>Exit
Hood, R. Sentinel points to the cabin. Halcom goes slowly,
as if to enter. Halts at door and turns.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Keele Brightly, the chances of war have favored
you. I am the last of my family. My mother’s ashes are still
unavenged. I have had faith in God. Justice may come at
last from other hands than mine. (<i>Turns and enters the cabin,
and falls on one knee. Sentinel locks the door. Brightly leaves
R. As he disappears, Sentinel resumes his beat, and Zina shows
around L. end of cabin, and taps lightly to attract Halcom’s attention.
He hastens to listen.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Peering between the logs.</i>) It is I, Zina, come to
save you. There is a bar behind the door. Bar the door on
the inside, and make no noise. Then return quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> God bless your brave little heart! (<i>Bars the door,
and returns to listen.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> This cabin is close to the river. Your friends are on
the other side. The walls are too strong to be broken. I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>climb to the roof, tear off some boards, throw a rope over a
limb, and drop it through the opening. On this, ascend to the
roof quickly. The river is too deep to ford. A log is lodged
on the shore in rear of the cabin. With the rope, swing yourself
astride this. Pull a rope fastened to the other shore, and
it will soon land you with your friends on the other side. If you
are fired upon from this side, throw yourself into the water and
cling to the log.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> But what chance of escape is there for yourself?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Don’t fear for me.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> I will not accept my life, even, at the slightest risk
to your own.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Do not hesitate. If you do, you are lost.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Tell me, on honor, is there any danger for yourself?
(<i>Enter Brightly, with squad of men, for execution, R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> On my honor, I shall be safe. Watch for the rope.

Orderly! (<i>Enter Ord. L. U. E.</i>) Tell the commissary

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> (<i>Rushing to grasp his hand.</i>) In heaven’s name,
Halcom, from where do you come?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> The rebel camp.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> How did you escape? (<i>Men offer clothing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Ask God, and the angel sent to my relief. (<i>Declining
clothes.</i>) Thank you, gentlemen, I need nothing now
but a coat.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Ah! A woman at the bottom of it. (<i>Halcom
watches out R.</i>) I sent word to Hood that if any harm came
to you, I would retaliate on every rebel officer in my charge.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Thank you, General. But your communication
would, doubtless, have come too late. But for my escape, I
should have been executed two hours ago.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Your escapes are marvelous. By the way, I have
orders from Washington to advance you to the first vacancy
among the corps commanders.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> (<i>Dropping his head.</i>) I had not expected that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Why not? In this army, sir, the best man wins.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> I am a native and citizen of the south.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> There are no lines for loyalty in this country.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> I am indebted to you for this.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> You are indebted to your own right arm, sir.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> I have been but a simple soldier, no more entitled
to advancement than the private who takes the brunt of the fight
in the first line.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Halcom, some men are born to command—to lead
a forlorn hope—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Which I never have.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Indeed! When at Lookout Mountain the storm
of rebel shot had melted the first line, and the reserves were already
wavering, and you seized and dared them to follow their
flag, rallying the broken ranks to that wild charge that swept
the rebel army from its entrenchments among the clouds, it was
a glory beside which the command of this army pales into insignificance!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Then the soldier shares equally with his commander!
(<i>Watches out R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> But you have not told me of this marvelous escape.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Ask me of something I cannot comprehend, and
you have all I can give.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> It often acts like that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> How?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Simple as any other phase of life. A storm at
night. A handsome cavalier, unjustly condemned, awaiting execution.
A lovely maiden hovers near. She drugs the guard,
and sets the prisoner free. Bewildered by the ecstasy of love
in such a moment of excitement, both are lost in its wild delirium.
They wake to an utter incomprehensibility of all that has
passed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> General, I am content if such chafing pleases you.
But I am weighted with an anxiety that will drive me mad.
When I can know the heroic girl is safe, who perhaps has sacrificed
her life to save mine, I can forget that I am a coward, and
unfit to live! (<i>Crosses over to L.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Ah! I am getting interested in this case. Who
is this woman? What do you fear? Where is she? I can hardly
imagine a situation in this country or in either army, that can
be dangerous to a woman!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> No danger to a woman? They killed my mother
when she was helpless, and, with my sister, burned her in her
own home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Such men are devils!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> And so am I! Can you trace the maniac through
Nashville, Chickamauga, and over Lookout Mountain, to the
banks of this river, and not guess at the origin of the hell that
is so fast consuming my life?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Treat it calmly, Halcom. It is something that
can never be mended. Leave the past to take care of itself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> There are fires that refuse to be quenched. No one
has struggled more manfully than myself to forget this. When
I would forget, memory conjures up the scene in the old home!
My mother’s helpless struggles with the devils who crushed her
innocent life! Of my sister burned alive! My God! How
can I forget this?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Tell me of your capture and escape.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> (<i>Hesitating.</i>) My division was overwhelmed by
the whole rebel army. In the desperate struggle, I was left
wounded and senseless on the field of battle. I was discovered
by my old enemy and conveyed to an old hut on the banks of
the Chattahoochee. After a parley with Hood and others, I was
tried by a drum-head court-martial for treason to my native
state, and sentenced to die fifteen minutes later. I was remanded
to the hut to await the preparations for my execution. I could
see no chance for escape, for Brightly had the details of my execution
at his own command. The rifles were already loading
that were to send me to eternity. I had sunk on my knees for
the last prayer, when a tapping on the logs outside, in rear of
the hut, attracted my attention. I hastened to listen. It was
too dark to see. But through the crevices between the logs, I
learned that the little rebel owl who had escaped <i>your</i> bullet, because
she was not a man, had come to effect my escape.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> That child? Surely, I was only in jest.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> That heroic child had eluded your guard, swam the
river at midnight in the violence of that terrible thunder-storm,
dragging a log hitched to a rope that led to the friendly shore,
that I might escape.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Impossible!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> I refused to save my life at the hazard of hers.
She had planned to escape with me. I heard the tramp of the
soldiers detailed to take my life. I heard her clambering to the
roof of the hut; the orders to drag me out to die; the sentinel
try the barred door; the crack of the breaking boards as she
was making an opening for my escape; the crash of the axe
breaking the door; an order that sent the devils to the roof to
prevent my escape; the ring of her pistol as she drove them
back to the earth again. The door crashed in, and the devils
were upon me; a rope fell at my feet. With almost superhuman
strength, I flung them back and gained the roof. A crowd were
clambering up the sides to destroy us. I sprang forward to her
defence. In an instant, she pushed me clear of the hut, safely
into the river.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> <i>Did you leave her!</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> The next flash of lightning revealed her on the
roof, with her knife drawn, holding the traitors at bay, that I
might escape. I sprang back for the shore. I heard a splash
in the water. The next lightning flash revealed her battling the
rapids of the river to gain the other shore. A shot from the
rebel side, and all was dark again. I sprang after her. Two
hours I have frantically searched this bank of the river, without
avail. She has perished in the rapids of the river, or by that
coward shot from the rebel rifle, and I live like a coward! (<i>Zina
staggers in at R. U. E., as if unconscious of the presence of any
one; wounded in the left side of the head, often looking behind
to see if she is pursued. She staggers and is about to fall,
when she is discovered by Halcom, who springs forward, and
catches her in his arms. Sherman tears off his military cloak,
and wraps it about her.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> She has fainted.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> And is wounded. (<i>They revive her.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Please let me stay on this side of the river.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Let you stay on this side of the river! I will
shoot any man who attempts to prevent it! You shall command
this army if you like. (<i>Zina faints again.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> The poor child is dying.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherman.</span> Not a bit of it. She is too smart to die! Take
her to my quarters. Orderly, here! (<i>Enter Ord. L. U. E.;
with Halcom takes her out, L. U. E.</i>) Have my surgeon attend
that girl, and tell him if he lets her die, I will hang him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>an hour after. (<i>Exit Ord. L.</i>) I am the biggest ass in the

that, don’t you be a botherin’ me.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Now you git out. I guess it was jest about as

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Lt. D’Arneaux, when you entered the military service,
I believed that you would soon wear the stars of a division
commander. Instead, you have presented us with the strange
anomaly of patriot and traitor. While to me you have presented
a soul of honor, you have sought every opportunity to strike
your country a cowardly blow in the dark!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. And I deny the falsehood with my whole soul and life.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Under the circumstances, a denial is wholly unnecessary.
You have had a fair trial. No one regrets more than
myself the military necessity that compels me to sign the warrant
for your execution. Your brilliant military record is no excuse
for disloyalty, and a most flagrant treason.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. As I expect to meet God before the next sunset, that
accusation is doubly false, though it comes from your own lips!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> There are a score of witnesses who saw you attempt
the life of your superior officer. (<i>D’A. hangs his head in silence.</i>)
If there had never occurred another offence, the articles
of war meet you with the bullet. (<i>To guards.</i>) Remove
the prisoner to the care of the guard. (<i>Ex. D’A. and guard, L.</i>)
Orderly! (<i>Enter rebel Orderly, L. U. E.</i>) Take this dispatch
to Gen. McGruder. (<i>Exit Ord. with dispatch. Enter Keele
Brightly, L., salutes.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I have the honor to report that I have captured
two Yankees, found lurking within our lines as spies.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Have them brought in. (<i>Brightly salutes and retires,
L.</i>) The camp is swarming with them! It is utterly useless to
attempt to prevent it without recourse to the most severe measures!
This careless indifference of the guards allows a constant
betrayal of my means of defence. (<i>Enter Brightly, L., followed

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> Well, sir, what have you to say for spying?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Now you get out! Why I know you (<i>grabs

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hood.</span> No, sir!</p>

Hez. look at each other a moment in silence.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> He will do that?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> That’s the kind of hairpin he is.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> The blackguard!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Wal, I guess I’ve airn’t the powder and shot. If
my old shooter hain’t tapped a hundred and fifty er them critters,
you can jest hope ter holler.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> I will get some lawyer to appeal that coort.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You get out!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> That was no coort. The constitution of Ameriky
says nothing about a coort like that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> It don’t make no difference. The shootin’ will
come. They don’t care for constitewshuns down here.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> I’ll have that thafe tried for murder if he does that.
And I’ll tell him that to his face, too. I don’t care who any man
is that will do an illagal thing like that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> They don’t stop for law down here.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> The more the shame for ’em. He will have the
contimpt er the wurruld upon ’im.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> It wouldn’t do no good. They’ll bury you at daylight.
(<i>Short silence.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> And there ain’t niver a praste to be had in this
haythen country at all.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Ye don’t need none. If I hain’t licked rebels
enough ter get ter heaven without a priest, they can jest kick
me out.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Havn’t I done that same meself?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> So ye have, Barney, and this ain’t yer own country,
neither. If they don’t give ye two harps to my one, it ain’t
doin’ the fair thing by ye.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Divil a bit do I care for a harp, if I can get out er
this. (<i>Door opens, and Sally appears with two carbines in her
hands; hesitates a moment.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Now let me die.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> ’Pon my word.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Come here, and let me see if you ain’t a ghost.
(<i>Sally lays carbines behind the box and rushes to embrace Hez.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Give us a taste er that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> You git out. There ain’t enough ter go round.
(<i>Sally tries to unfasten irons.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Oh don’t you spread yourself. I have one er thim.
(<i>Turns away.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sal.</span> (<i>hunting round for axe.</i>) Hain’t ye got no axe, Hez.?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> ’Taint no use, Sal. Them irons can’t be broke.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> You git out, Hez. You jest show me where they
keep the axe.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> They don’t leave no axes round here. If ye had
one, ye’d get up such a noise, old Hood and the whole coop
would be down here whoopin’.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> I got the whole caboodle asleep with opium.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> ’Taint no use, Sal. That Keele Brightly said
we was spies, and we’re goin ter get shot at daylight. (<i>Sally
speechless with astonishment.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> The thafe. (<i>Sally drops on her knees sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Oh what shall I do?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> I know how’ yer heart is, Sal, but ye can’t do us
no good. Jest git out as fast as ye can, and save yourself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> And tell Gineral Halcom about it, and divil a bit
but he will bat that spalpeen in the mornin’.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> (<i>Springing to her feet and wiping eyes.</i>) I have it.
(<i>Dashes for the door.</i>) I know what I’ll do.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Say, Sal. (<i>She turns back.</i>) Perhaps I shan’t
never see ye again. (<i>Sally falls on his breast sobbing.</i>) Tell
mother she ain’t got nothin’ to be ashamed on about me, except
I’m rough, and can’t talk so fine as some folks. Now she is
cheated out of her part er the farm, and the old man is so mean.
I don’t know what she <i>will</i> do. I’ve sent her all my wages and
bounty.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sally.</span> Keep yer upper lip solid, Hez.; cos if yer lost to yer
mother, she can have a home with me as long as she lives. Good
bye. I got to get ye out, and I ain’t no time to lose. (<i>Dashes
out at R. door.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> ’Pon my word, that gal will knock the hell’s blazes
out er thim spalpeens, or I’m a thafe and a liar.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Ain’t she a rusher?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> ’Pon me word she is. Yer a lucky boy to have a
gal like that.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Makes me sick, cos it’s all goin’ for nothin’.
(<i>Makes a bad face, as if to cry.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Ah-r, don’t be doin’ that. Thim blackguards will
be sayin’ yer a Yankee coward.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> The man that can’t grind out some grief at leavin’
a gal like that, ain’t got brains enough to know what he’s losin’.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Indade! Isn’t Biddy Maloney as fine a gal as she,
barrin’ the fitin’? (<i>Door opens at R., and Keele Brightly enters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>followed by D’Arneaux and guard, one of whom proceeds to iron
D’A. to the same ring with Hez. and Barney.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>Looking about and at prisoners.</i>) As incomprehensible
as ever. The guard drugged and disarmed, and the
prisoners unmolested. Corporal, place a guard of twenty men
around this building, and you have my orders to shoot any person,
man or woman, approaching it without authority. I have
placed a barrel of powder beneath, with a fuse attached, leading
out under the door. If the Yankees attack us before daybreak,
fire the fuse, or kill the prisoners, and join your regiment
at once. (<i>Guard leaves with Corporal, R. Brightly
lingers to see all is secure, then leaves R.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>To Barney.</i>) Bet ye tew dollars this old machine
is about gin out. They’re killin’ their own.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> (<i>To Hez.</i>) Is he a Gineral? (<i>D’A. hangs head.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>To D’A.</i>) Say! Yer couldn’t tell a feller who’s
gittin’ licked outside, could ye? (<i>D’A. gives them no attention.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> (<i>To D’A.</i>) You don’t be talkin’?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>To D’A.</i>) Talk is cheap, and I thought I’d
give ye a chance on what ye had the most on.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Shoot thim at daylight, sez he. (<i>Makes a bad
face as if about to cry.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Don’t be blubberin’, Barney.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Don’t you see the daylight is comin’ through thim
cracks there?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Let her come. It ain’t goin’ to last long. (<i>A
board lifts up at L. and Zina crawls up through.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Zina!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Now let me die!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> ’Pon my word! (<i>Zina motions quiet.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> The guard! Master D’Arneaux, how are you here?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. A victim of the falsehood of your master.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> How?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Convicted of treason by false testimony, and sentenced
to die at sunrise.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh this is so cowardly and <i>unjust</i> to you, who have
been so brave and kind. Oh what <i>shall</i> I do?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. You can do nothing, Zina.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I will go to the General and say it is <i>not</i> true.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. You are but a poor slave girl. It would avail nothing.
Zina, through economy and speculations, I have become possessed
of five thousand dollars in gold. It is all buried beneath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the roots of the old cotton-wood that stands by the grave of our
Nelly. No one but my mother knows this. If, by the fortunes
of war, I should fall, it would keep my mother from want. If,
when peace and independence come, and I should live, to buy
your freedom, when I had determined to offer you my heart,
hand, and the honor of a soldier.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh you <i>would</i> not throw yourself away on a poor slave!
You <i>do</i> not know what you say!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. This has been the nurtured ambition of my heart, since,
with all your native goodness, I saw your generous devotion to
my helpless old mother.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> How <i>can</i> you love a poor, degraded slave girl, who
has <i>nothing</i> to offer but these miserable rags, and the memory
that she came of the hated race, so despised by all the world.
(<i>Falls on her knees, covers face.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. As God loves goodness in the human heart—as manhood
admires the noble, unselfish woman, though her covering
be undeserving rags—as the heart plays captive to the most
generous impulses of nature—as the honor of a soldier reaches
out to grasp its ideal, so do I offer my tribute of love. Zina,
all these dreams of the future die with me when the sun rises
over the eastern hills. Go out from here. Avoid the guard.
Find the money, and fly with my mother, where you can be
free. Save my mother from want, and I am content. Waste
no time, or you too may be lost.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Oh I cannot be so cowardly as to leave you now!
(<i>Rising.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Why did you come here, where there is nothing but
danger?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Pointing to Hez. and Barney.</i>) To save <i>these</i> who
have been so good and kind to me. When my master had turned
me away to starve, <i>these</i> men gave me their own food and blankets
when the storm was cold and pitiless. (<i>Shot R. Zina
goes to R. door to listen.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. (<i>To Hez. and Bar.</i>) My hand, good fellows. One
often sees that to admire in an enemy. (<i>Shake all, Hez. grudgingly.
Zina looks around the room and discovers the carbines,
places them on the box.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> When I was first lookin’ at ye, didn’t I be knowin’
ye was no blackguard.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. When the other world begins to lift its shadows to light
us to the other side, the animosities of this life should be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> (<i>To D’A.</i>) Give me your hand again. I allus
said I’d never shake with a rebel, but I’ll take it all back.</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Zina, before I die, there is a secret in your history the
excitement of the hour had well nigh caused me to forget. It
came to me by accident. You were not born a slave!</p>

<p class='c011'>Z. Then who am I?</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. A lost child of the Halcoms!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Falling on her knees and covering her face.</i>) My
brave, noble brother!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. While confined, previous to my trial, I overheard conversation
between Brightly and one of his ruffian comrades, detailing
your history and a plan for your destruction. The reason—slavery
is abrogated, and you are one of the Halcoms.
Seventeen years since, Brightly was the leader of a band of
Regulators, raised to protect the planters from the abolitionists,
who were running off their help. I was a member of that company,
though a mere boy. An old political grudge had existed
between Brightly and your father for many years. On a dark
December night, backed by a crowd of selected desperadoes,
he murdered your father when he was without means of defence,
outraged and killed your mother,—then fired the house.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Shuddering.</i>) My poor mother! (<i>Sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Some of those men are now standing guard around
this building. You were then a helpless infant in the cradle.
Old Milly, the nurse, escaped with you to the wood. Two days after
you were both kidnapped by Brightly, taken to his plantation
in Alabama, where he raised you as a slave. At the time of the
murder, your brother Frank, at the age of 12 years, was educating
in the free schools of New England. During the last 15
years he has not ceased to search for the murderer of his family.
He has no knowledge that you have been saved from the burning
home. Within the last three years, Brightly has repeatedly
tried to sell you to cotton planters on the coast. Only my vigilance
and the color of your skin have prevented it. It was
Brightly’s hand that sent the bullet after your life, on the night
of your brother’s escape. If you are found here, your life is
lost. Go now. Day is breaking. God bless you. Remember
my mother. (<i>Distant rapid firing.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Springing to her feet and listening,</i>) Hark! My
brother is coming!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. Escape while you can. Quick, or you will be lost!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> (<i>Flings off turban.</i>) I will defend you until his sword
shall save us!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>D’A. You cannot, you are a weak girl! (<i>Zina bars the
door and slings carbine on belt.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> So I can fight and die with you! (<i>Rebs. attack the
door furiously. Zina holds it.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. This building is mined and you will be blown to atoms.
(<i>Zina holds the door.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I have filled the powder with water!</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. You will be killed. Conceal yourself beneath the floor.
(<i>Rebs. knock holes in middle of door with an axe.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hezekiah.</span> Yes, go, Zina. God bless yer brave little heart.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Barney.</span> Please go, little girl, ye can’t do us no good! (<i>Heavy,
increasing firing R. Blows on the door rapid and continuous.
She holds it.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'>D’A. You cannot defend us! (<i>Zina seizes carbine and,
springing back, exclaims:</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> I am a Halcom! This rifle shall avenge my mother’s
life. (<i>Confederates smash the door until they knock it to pieces.
Then the door breaks down and a crowd of rebels rush through,
5 rapid shots from Zina and they retreat to outside, 3 men fall.
She drops the old and seizes another carbine as Brightly urges
them back. Five more shots throw them into a crowding confusion
at the door, when she stops firing from unloading. Brightly
and six soldiers rush to left front. Zina draws knife to defend
prisoners.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>As he and soldiers dash to L.</i>) Kill the prisoners.
(<i>Soldiers spring forward to bayonet them and are met by
Zina.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Who strikes the helpless is a coward! (<i>Soldiers hesitate,
with bayonets at her breast.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> You shall be food for my dogs!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> Coward! Thief! Assassin of my mother!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> So you bite the hand that fed you to life!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> My hands have earned your bread and mine!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>To soldiers.</i>) Kill her! (<i>Halcom dashes in R.
followed by soldiers, who cover rebs.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> Throw down your arms! (<i>Rebels drop arms and
Zina rushes into her brother’s arms saying:</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> My brother!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> I have long suspected this. My mother’s face lives
in this girl and in my memory seventeen years since as she
begged for mercy from a man who never felt it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> I am a prisoner of war.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> We have met, sir, for the last time. You shall fight
women and helpless prisoners no longer.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> Then have done with your preaching and come
on! (<i>Drops sword and draws knife.</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> I will not keep you waiting long! You shall fight
for your life this time like an honorable man!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Brightly.</span> (<i>To reb. soldiers</i>) The psalm of a traitor who
has stabbed his country in the back!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Halcom.</span> (<i>To prisoners and Union soldiers.</i>) If this man
passes my hands safely he shall go free! (<i>Taking advantage
while Halcom is speaking to the Union prisoners, Brightly rushes
forward to stab him in the back, treacherously. Zina catches his
purpose, drops on one knee, knocks his hand up and drives her
knife to the hilt in the ruffian’s heart. Brightly staggers back and
falls. Zina springs up, aghast at the result, then drops knife,
covering her face, says:—</i>)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Zina.</span> My poor mother! (<i>Drops on her knees, then face,
sobbing until curtain falls.</i>)</p>
